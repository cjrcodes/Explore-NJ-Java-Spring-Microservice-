Roy Fielding (One of the founding authors of REST API Spec and HTTP)

- He says an API is not truly restful unless it follow a uniform interface
-   One of the constraints of this is that HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the engine of Application State) is employed
- Expose the API's documentation
- Navigation between resources
- Spring Data REST is Hypermedia driven natively
- e.g.
    - {
        "_links": {
            "self" : {
                "href" : "http://localhost:8080/profile"
                }
    }

- Spring Data REST employs the HAL (Hypermedia Application Language) standard
